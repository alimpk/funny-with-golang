# Golang Structs and Pointers
Pointers in Golang is a variable which is used to store the memory address of another variable. Pointers in Golang is also termed as the special variables. The variables are used to store some data at a particular memory address in the system.

You can also use a pointer to a struct. A struct in Golang is a user-defined type which allows to group/combine items of possibly different types into a single type. To use pointer to a struct, you can use & operator i.e. address operator. Golang allows the programmers to access the fields of a structure using the pointers without any dereferencing explicitly.
